// Legion of Doom
// Send Feedback
// Lex Luthorâ€™s Legion of Doom is a tough organization to get into, even for greatest supervillains. Recently, a spot has opened up because The Mad Hatter has retired. Harley Quinn doesn't want to waste this opportunity, and jumps at the chance of the interview. But she has a PhD in psychology, not in Computer Science. She has kidnapped you and will let you go only if you are able to solve the evil questions of Lex Luthor.
// You are given an array of N elements, which are initially all 0. After that you will be given C commands. They are -
// 0 p q v - you have to add v to all numbers in the range of p to q (inclusive), where p and q are two indexes of the array.
// 1 p q - output a line containing a single integer which is the sum of all the array elements between p and q (inclusive)
// Input Format:
// In the first line you'll be given T, number of test cases.

// Each test case will start with N and C. After that you'll be given C commands in the format as mentioned above
// Constraints:
//  1 <= T <= 10
//  1 <= N, C <= 10000
//  1 <= val <= 10^8
//  1 <= p <= q <= N
// Output Format:
// Print the answers of the queries in new line for each test case.
// Sample Input 1:
// 1
// 8 6
// 0 2 4 26
// 0 4 8 80
// 0 4 5 20
// 1 8 8 
// 0 5 7 14
// 1 4 8
// Sample Output 1:
// 80  
// 508
